    <p>Hello! This is Perri Speaking. I made this website so my friends and family can
        easily access my current and past reads. I hope to update this as time goes on,
        so check back for (hopefully) regularly added reviews! This small project
        of mine was inspired by the Prelinger Library's "Stacks" program. While my
        take on it isn't nearly as complex, I owe my results to the creators of Stacks.
        Also also, I'm currently looking for internship opportunities in software 
        engineering. If anyone can point me to opportunities, or if anyone knows anyone
        that can help me, my LinkedIn and Github are right here!
     </p>
